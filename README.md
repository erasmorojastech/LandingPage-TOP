## ✨ Overview
A simple landing page built as part of The Odin Project curriculum to practice HTML and CSS, with a focus on Flexbox. The page is structured into several sections, including a hero area, information cards, a quote, and a call to action.

## 🎨 Design
The design was provided as two images: one showing the full webpage layout and another detailing the fonts and colors used. The goal was to replicate the design as closely as possible using HTML and CSS Flexbox, without worrying about pixel-perfect accuracy.
